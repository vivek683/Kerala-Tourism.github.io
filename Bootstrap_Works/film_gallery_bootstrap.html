                <p class="font-monospace">The story begins with construction workers trying to uproot a tree, which
                    causes a dead body to hang
                    out of the tree. Postmortem reveals the body to be at least a year old and hence in very bad shape
                    and it can't be identified. It is taken to a hospital. At night, the dead body opens its eyes,
                    causing all lights in the hospital to explode.

                    The story moves on to Reyna Kapoor (Sanjeeda Sheikh), who used to be an excellent surgeon (
                    according to her, surgery is her first love). An incident that happened in her life had caused her
                    to get PTSD and hence she is unable to do surgeries.
                    At the beginning of the series, she has recovered and is planning to take a test to confirm that she
                    is ready to go back to surgery. But as she begins to take the test, a power outage occurs, with the
                    lights exploding. The test is rescheduled for another week.
